        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is <span class="gold_text">Micheal Hansen</span>, and I'm an aspiring developer from Portland, Oregon, currently training at <em>Epicodus</em>'s boot camp.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I graduated with a <strong>Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics</strong> from <em>Portland State University</em> in 2014</li>
          <li>After college, I worked as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> for <em>Beyondsoft Consulting</em></li>
          <li>After leaving Beyondsoft, I started learning about programming in depth, ultimately enrolling at <em>Epicodus</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>My experience at Beyondsoft is what motivated me to seek further training in programming. I was hired for the job based on my knowledge of mathematics, but the job relied a lot on programming, which I had to learn "on the fly". However, I greatly enjoyed the challenge and puzzle of coding, and decided to undergo more comprehensive training in the interest of pursuing it as a career.</p>
        <p>Most of my interests resolve around puzzle solving. I love finding a difficult problem, and then working my way towards a solution. This is what lead me to learn how to code, starting originally with python, and now working to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well. In my free time, I also enjoy puzzles like crosswords and sudoku. I have little time for television any more, but I like to watch NJPW when I can.</p>
